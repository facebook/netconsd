# netconsd-regexps.txt - Configuration file for netconsd logger module
# This file uses YAML-style sections to organize regular expressions
# Lines starting with # are comments and will be ignored
# Empty lines are also ignored

# Examples of regular expressions:
# .*error.*           - matches any line containing "error" (case sensitive)
# (?i).*warning.*     - matches any line containing "warning" (case insensitive)
# ^DEBUG:             - matches lines starting with "DEBUG:"
# \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}   - matches date patterns like "2023-12-25"
# kernel:.*oops       - matches lines containing "kernel:" followed by "oops"
# (failed|error|panic) - matches lines containing "failed", "error", or "panic"

# netcons messages that match these regexps are just dropped.
# Useful for suppressing noisy repetitive messages.
ignore:
  - (?i).*debug.*
  - \[\s*\d+\.\d+\].*usb.*disconnect
  - kernel:.*audit.*
